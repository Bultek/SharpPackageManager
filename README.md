# SPM

## Hi folks, we are sad to announce that spm is discontinued. we will shut down the repo within the next month and that'll be it. You will be able to fork this repo and continue the project. The reason why we shut it down is very simple: we don't need it, and the community doesn't need it as ```winget``` covers *almost* everything that SharpPackageManager does. Also project's code is kinda old and has to be majorly refactored, but we don't have time for it.
